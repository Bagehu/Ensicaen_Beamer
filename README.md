# Ensicaen_Beamer
A rather simple template for beamer presentations using Beamer (LaTeX)

As for  other Beamer  slideshows, you  shall compile  it two  times in
order to update the structure. Comments should help you understand the
different options  that you have  at your disposal.   Customization is
completely done  in the .sty files  and these should stay  in the same
directory as the .tex.

## Side note
I do  NOT own the ENSICAEN's  logo, and it is  obviously excluded from
the license terms.
